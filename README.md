## 1) Motivation & Target Audience 🎯

In today's society, the world is changing rapidly and people tend to lead a hectic lifestyle pursuing greater achievement. In the process, they tend to neglect their physical health due to several reasons such as feeling tired from work, lack of time to exercise, and etc. According to the World Health Organization, the prevalence of obesity across the globe has almost tripled between 1975 and 2016. The increasing trend of obesity is worrying because its underlying impact would be a higher risk of developing obesity-related health problems such as diabetes, heart disease and stroke which would result in higher health cost for every country and reduced productivity. In view of this issue, our team came up with SG Spot Sports, a friendly mobile application designed to facilitate and ease the trouble of finding the desired physical activities to participate and makes exercising a fun activity! The target audience for our application includes anyone who are seeking an active lifestyle. 🏃

## 2) User Stories 📰

2.	As a young adult, I would like to keep an active and healthy lifestyle and achieving it through the sports that interest me would further motivate me to work harder towards my personal goals

## 5) Features yet to be Implemented 🔧

> Due to timeline constraints and unforeseen errors in the system, certain features could not be fully accomplished yet.

1. Search function
