### 1) Motivation & Target Audience

In today's society, the world is changing rapidly and people tend to lead a hectic lifestyle pursuing greater achievement. In the process, they tend to neglect their physical health due to several reasons such as feeling tired from work, lack of time to exercise, and etc. According to the World Health Organization, the prevalence of obesity across the globe has almost tripled between 1975 and 2016. Furthermore, studies found that the most significant weight gain occurs when people enter the workforce for full-time jobs. The increasing trend of obesity is worrying because its underlying impact would be a higher risk of developing obesity-related health problems such as diabetes, heart disease and stroke which would result in higher health cost for every country and reduced productivity. In view of this issue, our team came up with SG Spot Sports, a friendly mobile application designed to facilitate and ease the trouble of finding the right physical activities to participate and makes exercising a fun and interactive activity! The target audience for our application are broad, and includes anyone who are seeking an active lifestyle. üèÉ
